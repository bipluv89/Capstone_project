    "<h1> <font size=\"3\">Background: </font></h1> Melbourne and Sydney are the 2 main cities when living in Australia is considered or analysed. Although there are other beautiful and growing cities in Australia,People outside of Melbourne mainly look at the living standards and day to day life of these 2 cities mainly. Both the cities are similar in natural beauty, resource, places to visit, population, diversity, job opportunity and career opportunities. Yet an analytical view comparing the cities will have a very vast user base. My report will mainly target the migrant population to Australia\n",
    "\n",
    "<h1> <font size=\"3\">Problem: </font></h1> Australia has a very good migration policy and every year Australia accepts nearly 200,000 population as part of skilled migration programs. These people migrating to Australia normally do not have an analytical view of which City they have to land after receiving their permanent residency visa.Normally, these people talk to friends , colleagues and online forums to create an understanding of cities of Australia.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h1> <font size=\"3\">Interest: </font></h1> My analysis will use clustering methods to cluster the suburbs of both the city and display various characteristics of the suburbs in these cities. Readers will be able view data for schools, restaurants, playgrounds, places to visit and jobs created for major suburbs in these cities and create a perspective of both the city on their own. This analytical view will not give an idea of which city is better rather this report will only provide a visual analysis of the major suburbs of the city and leave it to the reader to create a perspective.\n"

The reason for doing so is limit the data which I will be fetching from foursquare as there is cap on the amount data i can fetch in a day from Foursquare. Also, It gives the analysis of displaying data only for a a part of the city. People normally select the region first before selecting the suburb when they plan to live in a suburb. This solution can be extended to let users choose a particular region from a UI field an run the rest of the analysis based on that."
